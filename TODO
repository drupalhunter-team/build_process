10 add support for non-compilable-tests (piece of code, that should NOT compile) - .nct.cpp.
19 add doc file with description to project too (not only on web).
20 consider support for bcov (gcov?) integration with build process.
27 implement more scalable split backend functionality (enable/disable feature in given component).
30 add parameter that forces component to rebuild
35 think how to implement components in subdirectories (i.e. input/Impl1 with namespaces Input::Impl1).
48 fix problem with passing some flags to make, like 'make -k'.
53 support for testing in C only (.t.c and .mt.c) - low priority.
