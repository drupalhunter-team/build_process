2  fix bug with spaces in project dir path.
10 add support for non-compilable-tests (piece of code, that should NOT compile) - .nct.cpp.
19 add doc file with description to project too (not only on web).
20 consider support for bcov (gcov?) integration with build process.
25 rename project ot 'build_system' which is more adequate.
27 implement real split backend functionality.
29 simplify template for tests - test class is in unnamed namespace, therefor no prefixes are needed (TestClass is enought).
30 add parameter that forces component to rebuild
31 add support for ccache.
32 add support for distcc.
33 add support for force-link option.
34 make PROFILE=doc build stop when there are errors in comments.
35 think how to implement components in subdirectories (i.e. input/inputImpl1 with namespaces Input::InputImpl1).
36 add support for easy adding auto-tools-based external components (buuld in gen, then export includes and libs).
37 in bigger projects (i.e. dedal) there is WAY to big flag set for compilation - think what can be done about it.
38 update template for features.
39 add renaming MEM_DEBUG flag in the code, to use meaninful names.
41 check how to put 'public_headers.$(PROFILE)' in a proper directory.
42 add 'local' compilation flags (just for this particular component - not passed higher).
