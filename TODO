10 add support for non-compilable-tests (piece of code, that should NOT compile) - .nct.cpp.
19 add doc file with description to project too (not only on web).
20 consider support for bcov (gcov?) integration with build process.
27 implement more scalable split backend functionality (enable/disable feature in given component).
30 add parameter that forces component to rebuild
32 add support for distcc.
35 think how to implement components in subdirectories (i.e. input/Impl1 with namespaces Input::Impl1).
36 add support for easy adding auto-tools-based external components (build in gen, then export includes and libs).
48 fix problem with passing some flags to make, like 'make -k'.
52 optimize computing flags for dependent components using pre-compiled flag-files.
53 support for testing in C only (.t.c and .mt.c) - low priority.
54 add intel toolchain support (check ranlib and nm).
55 add warning when using icc with ccache - icc is broken and creates wrong output in dependency files.
