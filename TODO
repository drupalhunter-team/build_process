* add support for non-compilable-tests (piece of code, that should NOT compile) - .nct.cpp.
* add doc file with description to project too (not only on web).
* add parameter that forces component to rebuild
* think how to implement components in subdirectories (i.e. input/Impl1 with namespaces Input::Impl1).
* support for testing in C only (.t.c and .mt.c) - low priority.
* think about support for precompiled headers.
* add support for assertion's testing.
* write troubleshooting faq for begginers.
* consider adding automatic resuorce loading to program: objcopy -I binary -O elf32-i386 asdf.txt asdf.o --alt-machine-code=3 --redefine-sym=_binary_asdf_txt_start=content_of_asdf extern const char content_of_asdf[];
* add support for separating tests that last longer (*.lt.cpp?).
* refactor code so that flags passed to make can be only in form yes/no.
* add support for code coverage with bcov - enable code coverage only for selected piece of code.
* add build target creating documentation for whole project in one place (alldoc?).
* add error handling when *_dynamic_* script fail.
* consider adding clang to toolchains support.
* mtest for smll projects makefile.
