20 consider support for bcov integration with build process.
19 add doc file with description to project too (not only on web).
15 set order of -I so that component's dir will be before public includes (this will solve problem with unmarking header as public after build)
13 add template wrapper for try-catch when exception is expected.
10 add support for non-compilable-tests (piece of code, that should NOT compile) - .nct.cpp.
2 fix bug with spaces in project dir path.
