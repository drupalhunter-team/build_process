2  fix bug with spaces in project dir path.
10 add support for non-compilable-tests (piece of code, that should NOT compile) - .nct.cpp.
19 add doc file with description to project too (not only on web).
20 consider support for bcov (gcov?) integration with build process.
24 switch from copying .hpp files to linking (this prevents some strange bug that sometime appears).
25 rename project ot 'build_system' which is more adequate.
27 implement real split backend functionality.
28 embedded test suit should NOT be part of build system.

32 add support for distcc.
33 add support for force-link option.
34 make PROFILE=doc build stop when there are errors in comments.
