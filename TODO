21 add -rdynamic for compilation in debug* profiles (for backtraceability).
20 consider support for bcov integration with build process.
19 add doc file with description to project too (not only on web).
18 scripts for dynamic compile/link flags should take projects root as a parameter.
17 make include dir with links instead of '/* public header */' voodoo.
16 add warnings when config's standard variables are not set.
15 set order of -I so that component's dir will be before public includes (this will solve problem with unmarking header as public after build)
14 add common dependencies file (for all profiles).
13 add template wrapper for try-catch when exception is expected.
12 make gen/ profile dirs have flags information (TC, MEM_DEBUG, etc...).
10 add support for non-compilable-tests (piece of code, that should NOT compile) - .nct.cpp.
8 add dependencies on whole testdata/ dir.
6 add assert() macro wrapper for TUT so that it whould throw (asserts can be checked then as well).
2 fix bug with spaces in project dir path.
