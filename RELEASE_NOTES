* added force-link functionality.
* fixed small-projects-build-process and made it official part of build_process release.
* added test application for small-prj-build-process.
* added support for components build only in some profiles (ex. tests).

-- v1.1.2 --
* fixed 'missing dependency header' problem.

-- v1.1.1 --
* falgs for compilation and linking of profile mode are less restrictive.
* moved -rdynamic to linking, instead of compiling flags.
* switched from electric-fence to duma library for memory debugging, since the first one caused problems with pthreads.

-- v1.1.0 --
* added automatic check for project's rebuilding when build_process changed.
* fixed problem with building MEM_DEBUG=1 version to directory with "normal" version.
* template for tut-tests has been simplified a little.
* ccache support by setting WITH_CCACHE=1 option.
* fiex bug when linking tests for dynamic library.
* moved project-specific flags to the config.mk (i.e. in order to optimize builds for given hardware, etc...).
* gen directory now has links to header files instead of copyies.
* removing public headers and unmariking header to non-public again are now supported.
* added paraller build to bzr_build.conf for multicore computers.
* fixed bug with library relinking when coponent had common prefix with other library name.
* test application for AVRs added.
* out-of-the-box support for gcc toolchain for AVR uCs.
* inter-component dependencies and falgs checker has been rewritten from scratch.
* no features/deps/* file are needed now if component depends on nothing.
* features/deps/common_dynamic_compile and features/deps/common_dynamic_link files are now in use.
* added description of inter-component dependencies tracking in build_process/templates/features/deps/README.txt file.

-- v1.0.1 --
* fixed bug with common dependencies/libs-links for different TC/MEM_CHECK settings.

-- v1.0.0 --
* copying ublic headers has been improved.
* -I order has been preserved - other components won't be affected anyway.
* all dependency files are now optional - if you don't use them, you don't need them to exist.
* added 'common' dependency file, that is included for all profiles.
* testdata directory is now with own dependencies - anything that changes (add/modified) is also updated in gen/.
* change '/* public header */' to links in separete directory has been rejected due to problems with keeping two directories structures in sync in order to make it work.
* separate gen/* directories for different build options for profiles (np: toolchain).
* build_process tests now if proper variables are set (either via config or cmd-line parameter).
* added -rdynamic when building in debug (this allows backtrace reading in runtime).
* added reviesd BSD as a second license.
* fixed bug with missing symbols for applications
* dynamic link/compile + links in features directory.
* tests group's template has been simplified.
* added .out surfix to application naems, to avoid problem when app has the same name as its source direcotry.
* annoing message when dependecies have chenged is now removed - deps are updated automatically.
* toolchain selection is now possible via TC.
* added MEM_DEBUG falg - setting it to 1 causes to link with memory debug lib electric fence.
* moved profiles into separate files.
* fixed typo in test group template.
* added missing header to main.t.cpp.
* fixed bug with loosing compile-flags for dependencies.
* added support for dynamicaly generated compilation and link flags.
* automatic tests applicaiton(s) now return code dependent on test passing/failure.
* fixed bug with non-rebuilding test apps when inter-lib has changed.
* fixed bug with non-rebuilding libs/apps when dependency-lib has changed.
* support for doxygen documentation (PROFILE=doc).
* fixed bug causing mtests to rebuild own-lib sources twice.
* dynamic libraries support.
* evnirnonment is prepared for dynamic library support.
* TEST_COMPONENT flag no longer is needed.
* reorganisation of code - more common code separated.
