Small Projects Build Process
============================

this is make file dedicated for very small projects, where
full-featured build system is not required. it provides
basic functionalities like dependency tracking and
automated tests support.

to use it all you have to do is copy Makefile to your
directory structure and type 'make <target_name>'.
typical layout looks like this:

my_prj:
  Makefile
  CodePart1:
    src1.c
    src1.h
    src1.t.cpp
  CodePart2:
    src2.cpp
    src2.hpp
    src2.t.cpp
  src3.cpp
  src3.hpp
  src3.t.cpp
  main.cpp

makefile will automatically generate 'gen' output directory
for build results. this is the only place where outputs are
stored, therefor removing it makes your distribution
object-files-clean.

available targets are: debug, release, profile. note that
this differs from full-featured build_process, where these
are PROFILE's variable values, while targets are component
names. here it is simplified, since there are no other
components than the application you're building.

this project is a part of build_process package.
