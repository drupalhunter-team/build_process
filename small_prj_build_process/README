Small Projects Build Process
============================

this is make file dedicated for very small projects, where
full-featured build system is not required. it provides
basic functionalities like dependency tracking and
automated tests support.

to use it all you have to do is create proper directory
structure and type 'make <target_name>'. typical layout is:

my_prj:
  Makefile
  my_docs:
    some_doc_1.txt
    some_doc_2.txt
  my_sources:
    src1.c
    src1.h
    src1.t.cpp
    src2.cpp
    src2.hpp
    src2.t.cpp
    main.cpp

makefile will automatically generate 'gen' output directory
for build results. this is the only place where outputs are
stored, therefor removing it makes your distribution
object-files-clean.

this project is a part of build_process package.
